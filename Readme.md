# About Vltava Run

Our friends from Nike who have been regularly participating in the legendary
Hood To Coast (a 199-mile relay race in Oregon, USA, with over 1,000 teams
participating) spread their excitement and made us wonder whether there’s enough
space for a race like this in the Czech Republic. And we agreed that there is!
We launched the preparations and now we are happy to present VLTAVA RUN.

Vltava Run is a relay race from Šumava to Prague, with its 360-kilometre course
leading along hiking paths and country roads. It leads through the Šumava
National Park, along rivers and ponds, through the woods, along reservoirs on
the Vltava river, through beautiful valleys, over hills, and through the
historic towns and picturesque villages of southern and central Bohemia. Simply
put, it takes the most beautiful path towards the finish line.
